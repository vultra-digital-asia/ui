# Stage-publish Vultra packages to npm.
#
# npm does NOT rewrite pnpm-style "workspace:*" dependency specifiers when it
# packs/publishes a package (verified with `npm pack`). If a tarball is staged
# with "workspace:*" intact, installing it fails with:
#   npm error Could not resolve dependency: workspace:* not found in registry
# So before publishing we rewrite workspace:* -> the current workspace version
# of each @vultra/* dependency in every package's package.json.
#
# Publishing flow: npm stage publish -> approve on npmjs.com
# (Staged Packages) -> npm run stage:apply.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/stage-publish.sh [tag]
#   tag  npm dist-tag, default: alpha
#   --rewrite-only  only rewrite workspace deps, skip publishing (CI use)
