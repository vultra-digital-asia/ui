- [ ] `pnpm test` passes — no skipped tests without justification
- [ ] `pnpm build:all` succeeds — every package builds clean
- [ ] No Svelte compiler warnings (`state_referenced_locally`, `a11y_*`) in changed files
- [ ] No bundler warnings (circular deps, unresolved imports)

## Bundle Size

- [ ] `node scripts/check-bundle-budgets.mjs` passes — no package exceeds its budget
- [ ] New packages have a budget defined in `scripts/bundle-budgets.json`
- [ ] No unexpected size regressions in `dist/` of changed packages

## API & Documentation

## SSR & Hydration

- [ ] `ci.yml` passes: typecheck, test, build-all
- [ ] `deploy-docs.yml` builds successfully (docs + storybook)
- [ ] Bundle budgets check passes in CI (`node scripts/check-bundle-budgets.mjs`)

## Post-Release
